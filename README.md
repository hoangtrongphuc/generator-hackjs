## Contributing

To contribute PRs for these generators, you will need to clone the repo
then inside the repo's directory, run `npm link`. This sets up a global
link to your local package for running tests (`npm test`) and generating
new feathers apps/services/hooks/etc.

When finished testing, optionally run `npm uninstall generator-hackjs` to remove
the link.
